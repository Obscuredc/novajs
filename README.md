# novajs

## warning
novajs is *not complete*. Most functions are *useless* as of now.
It will become evident their use later. Do not write any programs with novajs (yet).
This is because function names may change, ect.

### usage
This is a very faulty physics program as it is for personal use.
I would apprectiate feedback.

### credit
It would be nice to credit me, or link to this github,
but not required.

### contribution
contributors wanted!
